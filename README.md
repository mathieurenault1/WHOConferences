Analysis of the WHO coronavirus conferences using NLP

In this project realized in cooperation with Diego Penroz Valenzuela, Text Mining techniques are
applied to transcripts of 100 press conferences held by the World Health Organization (WHO) from the
outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, in January 2020. After the preprocessing steps of the corpus
of documents are detailed, sentiment analysis is lead using Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment
Reasoner. Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization are used for topic modeling, creating a set of recurrent topics in the corpus. The sentiment value associated with those topics
throughout the conferences is then computed, following methods of Aspect-based sentiment analysis.
Various visualizations resulting from this analysis are produced using Tableau.
